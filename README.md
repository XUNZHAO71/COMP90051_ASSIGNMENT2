Summaryï¼š
We implemented a DANN model to address domain adaptation challenges in classification tasks. The model was compared against Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. Experimental results demonstrated that DANN achieved the best overall performance among all tested models.


How to run:
1. Open the notebook in JupyterLab or Google Colab.

2. Run all cells sequentially.

3. Ensure required packages (e.g., torch, sklearn, matplotlib) are installed.
